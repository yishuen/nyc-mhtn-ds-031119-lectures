## Flatiron Students Present

### Overview
Starting in module three students will participate in Flatiron Students Present (FSP). Each student will be paired with a partner or group of three and together they will prepare one â‰¤ 8 technical talk to present at FSP. FSP takes place on Tuesday nights at 6:15pm.


### Subjects
These talks should be about data science or data science-related topics. Be very conscious of the scope of your talk because it is common to pick too large a topic. As you are preparing your talk, you should practice delivering it and time yourself. Past topics include:

- [The History of GUI and Python](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OO0gNOCWwCdxigI_qBSvkFd91LoDjW8PKsKAgjJE-Io/edit#slide=id.p)
- [Hot Dog or Not Hot Dog: Introduction to CNNs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Eta3pvqTTIyT-WPiKl-CdR_VDcBqyiKNTVDJkhKtm6E/edit#slide=id.g4c8f6f631a_0_114)
- To GAN or not to GAN
- The Voice, Machine Learning and Siri
- Data Science of Gambling
- Recommendations for the Real World
- [Stocks vs. Data Science](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14aFahkyFXkFGKGFmASOIM-vQz95K05L767VNK07Qf5Y/edit#slide=id.gcb9a0b074_1_0)

### Timeline
- At least 1 week before your FSP (or ASAP), have your topic approved by a coach
- We will run through your presentation the day before FSP


### Slides
- You should have a Powerpoint/Google Slides to accompany your talk
- Don't fill your slides with text, only highlight the most important points on your slides
- Feel free to use fun photos or GIFs
- If you include code on your slides, you should have under 10 lines per slide


### Code
- Absolutely NO LIVE CODING.
- Code snippets (under 10 lines) and GIFs of code executing is OK


### Groups
You'll be preparing and presenting with a group of two or three. Make sure to split the workload and the presenting evenly, everyone should talk during the presentation.

### Practice and Prep
You'll be preparing for your presentation outside of classtime. Plan time to get together outside of school hours. On the day before FSP, you'll run through your presentation with an instructor and the other students presenting that day. Before FSP run throughs you'll...
  1. Have chosen and thoroughly researched your topic
  2. Have created well-organized and visually-appealing slides
  3. Practiced your presentation together and made sure you're within the time limit.

### Introducing Yourself

At the beginning of your presentation you'll want to introduce yourself to the audience. Aim for a short intro with your name, what you study at Flatiron School, what you did before, and what field you are interesting in.

There's no right or wrong way to introduce yourself. It's your story, so make it your own. :)

### Scheduling Issues
If you have prior commitments on the day you are assigned to present, find another group in your class willing to switch presentation days, and then let an instructor know about your switch.

### Questions?
Ask an instructor if you have any questions. Check in with your partner as soon as possible to confirm your presentation date and start thinking about a topic, so you'll have plenty of time to get questions answered.  

### Get Excited!
Flatiron Presents is a great opportunity to get practice speaking about a technical topic and to dive into a subject that interests you. Plus, you'll be teaching your classmates (and any members of the public who attend the meetup) something new!

Also, Flatiron Presents is open to the public, as well as students from every class each Tuesday. Support your fellow classmates and attend multiple FSPs!
